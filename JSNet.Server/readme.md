# Say hello to the latest project JSNet

To keep it short I have been playing around with nodejs creating a basic webserver
This server uses js classes with response types such as View() and Ok() in order display content to the browser

It is still in the early stages of development

Nunjucks has been included as the only dependency thus far to allow templating on html documents


I am planing to turn this into a cli to make it much easer to manage and get started. creating action for initiating a project as well as adding controller or views


implementing node cli for easy install following this tutorial
