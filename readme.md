# Say hello to the latest project JSNet

To keep it short I have been playing around with nodejs creating a basic webserver
This server uses js classes with response types such as View() and Ok() in order display content to the browser

It is still in the early stages of development

Dependencies for this project include
 - Nunjucks
 - NodeMailer


Cli has been added to project. server can now be installed by running
jsnet-cli --install you will then choose Javascript (the only version available right now) and it will install all the server files,

To start the server just type into the console npm run start

This server has been designed to act as a quick development server for api usage or to server html webpages
