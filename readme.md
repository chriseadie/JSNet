# Say hello to the latest project JSNet

To keep it short I have been playing around with nodejs creating a basic webserver
This server uses js classes with response types such as View() and Ok() in order display content to the browser

It is still in the early stages of development

Nunjucks has been included as the only dependency thus far to allow templating on html documents
